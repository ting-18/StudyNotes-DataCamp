# Understanding Cloud Computing
Cloud service models:

In cloud computing terms, IaaS means you "rent" the fundamental building blocks: networking, storage, and servers. PaaS includes the underlying infrastructure plus tools and software needed to build applications, such as operating systems and middleware. SaaS provides software via a web browser or app, with the hardware and OS managed by the vendor.

Using a cloud email tool means that you will rent the software, ready to go, usually for a monthly subscription fee.

More abstraction means less detail but easier management. The highest level of abstraction covers the entire system, while lower levels involve fewer components
