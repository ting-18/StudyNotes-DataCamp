In cloud computing terms, IaaS means you "rent" the fundamental building blocks: networking, storage, and servers. PaaS includes the underlying infrastructure plus tools and software needed to build applications, such as operating systems and middleware. SaaS provides software via a web browser or app, with the hardware and OS managed by the vendor.
