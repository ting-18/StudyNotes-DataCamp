- Five Vs of Big Data
Big data is commonly characterized by five Vs: volume (the quantity of data points), variety (type and nature of the data: text, image, video, audio), velocity (how fast the data is generated and processed), veracity (how trustworthy the sources are), and value (how actionable the data is). Data engineers need to take all of this into consideration.
